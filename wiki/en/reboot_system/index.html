    <h2 class="padding white imageFix">What is <img src="/upload_simulator/images/wiki_reboot_system.png" width="32" height="32">Reboot System in General?</h2>
    <p class="white indent font20px">Reboot system (or "prestige") is popular mechanic that is implemented in almost each casual, incremental or idle game - Upload Simulator also has one. Basically, this system means that all progress that you made in the game is reset, but your progression speed is a lot faster. That means that after each prestige you are progressing faster and faster. In Upload Simulator, you are claiming (getting) "perks" (we gonna talk about them later) after each reboot/prestige that you upgraded.</p>

    <h2 id="laboratory" class="padding white imageFix">What is <img src="/upload_simulator/images/wiki_lab.png" width="32" height="32">Laboratory?</h2>
    <p class="white indent font20px">In laboratory you can buy "perks" via <a href="../research_points/">Research Points</a>. In order to access laboratory, you must click on certain button on bottom panel.</p>

    <h2 id="perks" class="padding white imageFix">What are <img src="/upload_simulator/images/wiki_amplifier.png" width="32" height="32">Perks?</h2>
    <p class="white indent font20px">Perks are improving your game experience and sometimes are adding new buttons, menus and abilities! As i said before, you can buy them using <a href="../research_points/">Research Points</a>. There are a lot of different perks but in this article we gonna talk only about one, special perk: "Research Facility" or "Advanced Research Facility". This is your first perk that u gonna upgrade, and this perk literally doubles amount of <a href="../research_points/">Research Points</a> that you are getting per 1 TB of data (more about that in Research Points page). In order to upgrade Research Facility to Advanced version, you must buy another perk, "Advanced Research Facility". What Advanced version does? What's difference? There's only one difference: <b>you dont need to reboot to claim the perks</b>.</p>
