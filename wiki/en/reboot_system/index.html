    <p class="white indent font20px">The Reboot system (or "prestige") is a popular mechanic that is implemented in almost each casual, incremental or idle game - Upload Simulator also has one. This system causes your game to reset to the beginning, however, the progression speed increases. Progression increases over each reboot while also allowing you to gain certain perks which you can unlock.</p>

    <h2 id="laboratory" class="padding white imageFix">What is the<img src="/upload_simulator/images/wiki_lab.png" width="32" height="32">Laboratory?</h2>
    <p class="white indent font20px">In the laboratory you can buy "perks" using <a href="../research_points/">research points</a>. In order to access laboratory, you must click on the fourth tab in the bottom panel.</p>

    <h2 id="perks" class="padding white imageFix">What are <img src="/upload_simulator/images/wiki_amplifier.png" width="32" height="32">perks?</h2>
    <p class="white indent font20px">Perks help improve your game experience by adding new menus, abilities, etc! They can be bought using <a href="../research_points/">research points</a>. There are lots of perks which can increase your upload speed or prevent trolls from spawning. Since each new perk costs more than the last, the game mechanics also allow you to get more research points every time you upload 1TB of data you upload. The main perk, "Research Facility", increases how many research points per 1TB of data uploaded. Unless the "Advanced Research" perk has been unlocked, you need to reboot the game(explained above) to use new perks.</p>
